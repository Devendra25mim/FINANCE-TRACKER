# Project Statement — Finance Tracker (CLI)

## Problem Statement
Many people want to track daily personal expenses quickly without installing or configuring complex software. A minimal, no-friction tool is needed to record transactions, view totals, and analyze spending by category from the command line.

## Scope of the Project
This project provides a command-line, in-memory personal expense tracker. It supports interactive entry, retrieval, deletion, category filtering, and category-level summaries. The scope intentionally excludes persistent storage, authentication, multi-user support, and advanced reporting — all of which are viable future enhancements.

## Target Users
- Individuals who prefer quick, terminal-based utilities.
- Beginners learning Python and CLI application patterns.
- Developers/prototypers who want a small sample app for learning or demonstration.

## High-Level Features
- Add expense records with date, category, description, and amount.
- View a numbered list of all recorded expenses.
- Compute and display the total of all recorded expenses.
- Filter and display expenses belonging to a specific category.
- Delete an expense by selecting its displayed number.
- Compute category-wise totals for quick spending insights.
